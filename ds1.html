									<p>Below is the introduction to this design sprint, which will contextualize it for you.</p>
									<p>"In this design sprint, we will be examining the experiences of users of the Insight Timer, a meditation management app which is a popular alternative to similar apps such as Calm or Headspace, clocking in at over thirty million users. This app occupies a unique niche in the market of meditation-focused apps, in that it contains a free version, while Calm and Headspace require subscriptions effectively from the outset, and it appears to make a claim on more authenticity with respect to the traditions from which many meditation practices come. To examine this niche in personal health technology, as well as to illuminate the needs and priorities of those attuned to it, we interview three Insight Timer users and explore their experiences below. In summary, we find that users flock to Insight Timer because of its simplicity and directness in comparison with other apps, but would like it to be still less cluttered and burdened with distractions from the facilitation of meditation itself than it is."</p>
